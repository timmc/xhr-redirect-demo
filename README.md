# XHR Redirect Demo

A small Clojure app to test whether a browser preserves headers on
cross-origin XmlHttpRequest redirect.

Starts a web server on three ports. First port serves a web page with
Javascript that makes an XHR request to the second port; the response
is a redirect to a resource on the third port. The requests as seen by
the server are then displayed in the UI.

## Usage

`lein run`, then visit the URL displayed in the terminal.
