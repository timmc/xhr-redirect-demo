# XHR Redirect Demo

A small Clojure app to test whether a browser preserves headers on
cross-origin XmlHttpRequest redirect.

Starts a web server on three ports. First port serves a web page with
Javascript that makes an XHR request to the second port; the response
is a redirect to a resource on the third port. The requests as seen by
the server are then displayed in the UI.

## Purpose

Three parts:

- Demonstrate that headers set on a cross-origin XHR are preserved
- See what happens if that XHR requires preflight
- Base for other demos

## Usage

`lein run`, then visit the URL displayed in the terminal.

The demo uses `lvh.me` instead of `localhost` for local hosting; if
that site disappears or changes or you need to work offline, add
`127.0.0.1 lvh.me` to your `/etc/hosts` file.

## Results

- Firefox 38 and Chromium 48 convey custom headers on XHR redirect,
  but if the request requires preflight the redirect is
  rejected. Chromium is very explicit about this in the console log.
